## Reporting a Bug
There are two ways to report a vulnerability: opening a bug report, and issuing a private security advisory.  
You should open a bug report when:  
The bug has temporary effects,  
Or the bug cannot be used to give anyone an advantage in the game.  
If none of the above are true, or you are not sure which way to report the bug, please issue a private security advisory.
